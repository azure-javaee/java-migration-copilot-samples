# Migration Summary: Ant to Maven

## Overview
This document summarizes the migration of the OpenLibertyApp from an Ant-based build system to Maven. The migration was completed successfully, with the project now building correctly with Maven.

## Project Details
- **Project Name**: OpenLibertyApp
- **Original Build System**: Apache Ant
- **Target Build System**: Apache Maven
- **Java Version**: 11
- **Framework**: Spring MVC
- **Persistence Layer**: MyBatis/iBatis
- **Migration Date**: August 7, 2025

## Migration Steps Completed
1. Created Maven standard directory structure:
   - `src/main/java` for Java source files
   - `src/main/resources` for configuration files
   - `src/main/webapp` for web content

2. Created Maven build file (`pom.xml`) with all required dependencies:
   - Spring Framework (WebMVC, Context)
   - iBatis/MyBatis for database access
   - Log4j for logging
   - JavaMail API for email functionality
   - Jackson for JSON processing
   - Servlet API and JSTL for web features

3. Migrated source code:
   - Moved all Java files to `src/main/java`
   - Moved resource files to `src/main/resources`
   - Moved web content to `src/main/webapp`

4. Preserved configuration files:
   - Retained web.xml
   - Retained Spring configuration files
   - Retained MyBatis mapping files

5. Removed legacy Ant build files after successful Maven build

## Knowledge Base Reference
- **Title**: Migrate ant project to maven project
- **KB ID**: ant-project-to-maven-project
- **Description**: This knowledge base provides guidelines for migrating Ant projects to Maven projects

## Build and Migration Status
- **Build Status**: Success
- **Test Fix Status**: Not applicable
- **CVE Status**: Not applicable
- **Consistency Check Status**: Not applicable

## Next Steps
1. Configure Maven plugins for deployment if needed
2. Set up CI/CD pipeline for the Maven-based build
3. Add test coverage with Maven Surefire plugin
4. Consider upgrading dependencies to more recent versions for security and performance benefits

## Notes
The migrated application maintains the same functionality as the original but now benefits from Maven's dependency management and standardized project structure. This makes the project easier to maintain, extend, and integrate with modern development workflows.
