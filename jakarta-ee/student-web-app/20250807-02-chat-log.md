GitHub Copilot: I'll help you run the migration task to convert an Ant project to Maven. Let me use the appropriate tool to execute this task. I'll help you migrate this Ant project to Maven. Let's start by retrieving the knowledge base details to better understand the migration process. Now I'll examine the project structure to understand its components and create a migration plan. Let me also check the WebContent structure to understand the web application configuration: Let me check the Java files and what dependencies they use: Let me examine some of the Java files to understand their dependencies: Let me check if there are JAR files in the WebContent/WEB-INF/lib directory to identify dependencies: Let me check if there's an applicationContext.xml file: Let me create a directory for the migration plan: Now, I'll create the migration plan based on the information I've gathered: 

Made changes.

Now I'll execute this migration plan. Let's start by implementing the changes according to the plan.

### Step 1: Create Maven directory structure ### Step 2: Create pom.xml file 

Made changes.

### Step 3: Move Java source files to Maven structure

Let's move the Java files: 

edburns: I am in PowerShell. Can you use a PowerShell terminal and PowerShell commands?

GitHub Copilot: You're right, let's use PowerShell commands instead. I'll continue with the migration process using PowerShell syntax.

### Step 3: Move Java source files to Maven structure 

edburns: Well, your `migration_plan.md` says **Move** but your PowerShell command is copy. Don't you want to move them, not copy them?

GitHub Copilot: You're absolutely right! I should be moving the files rather than copying them. Let me correct that approach. 

### Step 4: Move resources to Maven structure 

### Step 5: Move web content to Maven structure I need to handle the WEB-INF directory specifically since it already exists: Let's move each JSP file first: Now let's move the WEB-INF contents: 

### Step 6: Build the project using Maven We need to add some missing dependencies to our pom.xml file: 
```


Made changes.


```
Let's build the project again: Great! Now let's update our migration plan to mark completed steps: 
```


Made changes.


```
### Step 6: Remove Ant build files 
```


Made changes.


```
Now let's create a migration summary: 

Made changes.

## Migration Complete!

I've successfully migrated your Ant project to Maven. Here's a summary of the changes made:

1. **Created Maven Directory Structure**:
   - Created java for Java source files
   - Created resources for configuration files
   - Created webapp for web application files

2. **Created Maven Configuration**:
   - Added a complete pom.xml with all necessary dependencies
   - Configured the Maven War plugin for web application packaging
   - Set up proper Java compiler settings (Java 11)

3. **Migrated Source Code and Resources**:
   - Moved Java source files to the Maven standard location
   - Moved resource files including MyBatis configuration
   - Moved web content including JSPs and WEB-INF configuration files

4. **Fixed Build Issues**:
   - Added missing dependencies (JavaMail, Jackson)
   - Ensured all required libraries are properly declared in the POM
   - Successfully built the project with Maven

5. **Completed Migration**:
   - Preserved the original Ant files as backups (.bak extension)
   - Created a detailed migration summary

The project now follows Maven conventions, which will make it easier to maintain, integrate with modern tools, and extend with additional functionality. The build process is now more standardized and can be easily integrated with CI/CD pipelines.
